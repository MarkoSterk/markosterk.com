Files of my personal website build with Python (Flask) and Bootstrap.
The website is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed via markosterk-app.heroku.com or www.markosterk.com

The app includes some more advanced features like contact form which utilizes sendgrid, JWT authentication, compression of responses and mongoDB database with a Schema validation inspired by the NodeJS' Mongoose module frequently used with ExpressJS. 

Feel free to use the back-end for your own blog/website and if you have any question don't hesitate to ask :)
