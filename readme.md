Files of my personal website build with Python (Flask) and Bootstrap.
The website is currently reachable at https://markosterk-app.herokuapp.com/
but will soon also be reachable at www.markosterk.com

The app includes some more advanced features like contact form which utilizes sendgrid, JWT authentication, compression of responses and mongoDB database with a Schema validation inspired by the NodeJS' Mongoose module
frequently used with ExpressJS. 

Feel free to use the engine and if you have any question don't hesitate to ask :)
